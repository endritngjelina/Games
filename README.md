# Games – Web-Based Experiments with 2D & 3D Engines

This is a collection of browser games and prototypes I created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Some of these are built purely with vanilla JS, while others use advanced libraries like **Three.js** (for 3D rendering) and **Cannon.js** (for physics simulation).

Each file in the repository represents a unique game or a different version of a gameplay idea I was working on.

### 🎮 Game Categories

- **Shooters** → `game shooting 0.html` to `game shooting 3.html`  
- **Maze Games** → `maze 0.html` to `maze 3.html`  
- **Card & Casino** → `game blackjack.html`, `game roulette.html`, `game lucky sevens.html`, etc.  
- **Platformers & Puzzles** → `game platformer.html`, `game puzzle.html`  
- **Memory Games** → `game memory v1.html` to `v3.html`  
- **3D & Physics-Based** (Cannon.js / Three.js)  
  - Examples: `car 10.html`, `cosmic explorer.html`, `particle effects.html`

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** – all games are built from scratch  
- **Three.js** – for 3D game rendering  
- **Cannon.js** – for physics interactions  
- No external frameworks or UI kits were used

### 💡 Why I Made This

This repo is part of my learning journey as a front-end developer and creative coder.  
I used this space to:

- Prototype game mechanics
- Practice visual/interactive design
- Learn by building (especially with physics & 3D)
- Improve my logic, animation, and DOM manipulation skills

---

### 🚀 Future Ideas

- Create a unified UI to navigate all game demos
- Host playable versions with GitHub Pages
- Add sound effects and animations
- Polish and merge game versions
